<h1>Chapter 1:  Introduction</h1>
   <p>GML supported hierarchical containers, such as
   <ol>
   <li>Ordered lists (like this one),
   <li>Unordered lists, and
   <li>Definition lists
   </ol>
   as well as simple structures.
   <p>Markup minimization (later generalized and formalized in SGML),
   allowed the end-tags to be omitted for the "h1" and "p" elements.
